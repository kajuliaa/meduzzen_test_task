How</h1>
  
    <section><h2>Use Cases</h2><p>1. A patient who is diagnosed with cancer and wants to know whether she has received chemotherapy treatment.



2. An engineer researching AI applications in healthcare to find out how they can improve patient care.
.


3. A doctor who needs an accurate diagnosis of a patient's condition from an AI system.
 (If you think about it, this could be many different scenarios.)


4. A physician looking at a chart and wondering if he or she is using all of the data available to them from the AI system to make a good decision.
 the AI may be able to answer that question better than the physicians could.
,


5. A nurse who needs information on what medications her patients might need and uses an AI application to help her decide which medication would be best for each patient.

 the AI will also be able analyze that patient's medical records, allowing him or her to learn more about his/her health history.

,, and. This article is using Google Docs. You can download it here.
 of course uses Google Sheets, but there are many other spreadsheet apps that you can try out as well. I recommend Excel because it has an easy interface and allows you to add tables and graphs easily. If you want to learn more about Excel, check this link

4. Use the right typeface

It is important that you choose the proper font when you create the paper. Choose the appropriate fonts that suit the content of your paper. For example, you could write the name of your company on the first page. However, if the company is located in Singapore, then choose a different font for the name. It will make the reader feel like he is reading from the point of view of someone who lives in Singapore.



5. Keep it simple!

Do not get lost with your writing style. If there is something you don't understand, ask someone else to help you. Instead of going through your whole paper trying to find the</p></section>
  
    <section><h2>Summary</h2><p>The following points will help you understand what AI is and how it works:
 in short â€“ Machine Learning (ML) is an approach to using computers to analyse data from natural or human-created sources. It involves learning a set of rules that allow computer programs to make predictions about new data. A specific example of ML would be the machine learning algorithm used by Google's search engine. In general, AI can be broadly described as "learning" through experimentation with many different types of data to produce accurate results.
 the difference between AI and Deep Learning.


ML algorithms are also known as Machine Learning because they involve training models on large amounts of data collected over time. These datasets include text, images, audio, video, and mathematical formulas. This type of dataset has been termed as Natural Language Processing (NLP), which refers to any system designed to process such data.
 in contrast to traditional statistical methods, such as linear regression and classification, ML algorithms rely on a number of machine learning techniques including Regression, Classification, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

machine learning algorithms usually have several components such as the model itself, a supervised learning algorithm, and an unsupervised learning algorithm.
