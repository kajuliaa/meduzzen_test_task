    <section><h2>Tools or Libraries</h2><p>A. C++ (or any language that can be compiled into machine code)

B. R (or Python/R)
 "Natural Language Processing" â€“ A term used to describe the process of identifying patterns from text using statistical analysis techniques. These techniques include but are not limited to word segmentation and document classification. It is also important to note that these techniques are often applied by humans in conjunction with natural language processing software such as NLP tools like Text Mining, Semantic Web Search, and others.
 the following books will help you learn more about this subject:
 and here's an interesting article on how artificial intelligence and text mining work together!</p></section>
  
    <section><h2>Call to Action</h2><p>Why healthcare professionals should be involved with AI?

What is the impact of artificial intelligence on healthcare?
 this question will help you create your call to action. What makes it important? How would it change healthcare? You can explain what impact the technology has had in other industries such as manufacturing, mining, agriculture, etc.

What are AI technologies?

AiRobotics Technology: Artificial Intelligence, Robotics & Autonomous Systems

Artificial Intelligence (AI): A term used to describe a set of cognitive processes by which computers process data to perform desired tasks. These processes include learning from experience, pattern recognition, decision making, etc.</p></section>
  
    <section><h2>Introduction</h2><p>What is AI in healthcare? What role does AI play in healthcare today? Why do we need AI to improve health care delivery? How can you apply AI to your job/career?

Section 1: Introduction

Who's working on it and why? Who benefits from using AI in health care? How has AI helped us reduce costs?
 was developed by the Center for Health Care Innovation at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn). This project uses machine learning techniques to make medical decisions. It provides physicians with an opportunity to improve their practice while reducing the cost of patient care through better coordination of care and improving efficiency.


Why healthcare?
 a) Healthcare is growing rapidly and will continue to grow in importance due to population growth, aging, and increased access to quality healthcare services. b) Many people work full time jobs that require them to travel frequently. c) People who work full-time jobs tend to spend more hours each day commuting than those employed part-time. d) Traveling also takes away valuable time from other activities such as hobbies, education, socializing, or leisure. e) People are increasingly living longer. Increasingly, many people will be unable to return home after traveling abroad, especially if they are ill or elderly. f</p></section>
